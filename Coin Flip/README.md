# Overview
I recently launched a blog post series where I will be posting about my journey in Web3/Blockchain security.
During this series, I will be posting about Web3/Blockchain bugs and exploits, alongside writeups for [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) and [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) challenges.

You can check [the third 'Fallout' Ethernaut challenge here.](https://fouedsaidi.com/2025/12/22/Ethernaut-Fallback/)

Today, I am following up on the Ethernaut challenges series presented to us by [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) !

Hope you enjoy it and learn something new!
